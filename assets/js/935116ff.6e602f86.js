Plugins are a way to share code between CLIs, to modularize a CLIs codebase, or allow users to add functionality to an existing CLI. With Node, we're able to have separate dependency versions sitting alongside one another. This means if you want to release an update to a dependency in one plugin, it won't affect how another plugin works. oclif takes this to an extreme and even flag parsing is done at the individual plugin level. If we ever want to make a breaking change to flag parsing (we certainly don't intend to, but this is just an example), you can update just one plugin and keep the old behavior in other plugins.
